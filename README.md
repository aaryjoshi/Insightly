# Financial Article Research Assistant

A research tool designed to analyze financial articles by ingesting URLs or text files and enabling intelligent, context-aware interactions.
Built with **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, **FAISS**, and **Streamlit**, this assistant streamlines the exploration of financial content using advanced NLP and retrieval systems.

## Features

* üåê **Flexible Input**: Load articles from URLs or upload text files containing URLs.
* üîç **Smart Preprocessing**: Seamless extraction and preprocessing via LangChain‚Äôs `UnstructuredURLLoader`.
* üß† **Semantic Understanding**: Convert articles into high-dimensional vectors using OpenAI embeddings.
* ‚ö° **Efficient Retrieval**: Perform similarity-based document search using FAISS for fast, accurate results.
* ü§ñ **LLM-Powered Q\&A**: Ask ChatGPT questions and receive intelligent, source-aware answers.
* üñ• **Intuitive UI**: Streamlit interface for real-time interaction, file handling, and dynamic user experience.

## Tech Stack

* **NLP & Retrieval**: LangChain, OpenAI Embeddings, FAISS
* **Interface**: Streamlit
* **LLM Integration**: OpenAI ChatGPT
